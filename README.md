## Data Structure

The IDN Area package organizes data into several models, each representing different administrative levels:

- **Province**: Represents the highest level of administrative division.
- **Regency**: Represents subdivisions within provinces.
- **District**: Represents subdivisions within regencies.
- **Village**: Represents the smallest administrative unit.
- **Island**: Represents geographic islands in Indonesia.

Each model has relationships defined to facilitate easy data retrieval.

### Example Relationships

```php
class Province extends Model {
    public function regencies() {
        return $this->hasMany(Regency::class);
    }
}

class Regency extends Model {
